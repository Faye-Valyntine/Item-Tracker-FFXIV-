# Final Fantasy XIV Gold Saucer Tracker
This is an item tracker that I made in Python for fun. 
Final Fantasy XIV fans will recognize these items but for anyone else, this is a list of prizes you can buy with in-game currency (MGP).
I used a dictonary to set-up the base lists and organized them into separate categories.
I utilized a command menu for the user to have access to multiple options such as: see the different categories with correlating totals, add and remove items from any of the categories, and see the grand total of every item.
